=========

The aim of this lib is to have a nice and simple way of writing a gui. My main inspiration is QML (Qt). I fnind to huge issue with QML : there is no simple C++ api and it is not lightweight at all to use QML, you will have to inculde all Qt framework.
So you will not find any kind of Button class nor RadioButton, Checkbox and other GUI stuff like that. 
I want to provide only the fewest item as possible to allow you to build every thing you need.

The mains functionnalities I aim to have at the end are : 
Based on a Scenegraph
Basic Node will be Item, Rectangle,Text, Sprite, NinePieceSprite, MouseArea, Column, Row, Grid
Anchors capabilities
Animation enable

I aim to do that as a library for game developpement, currently it's an executable. It is easier for to dev this way.

Feel free to do whatever you want with this.
